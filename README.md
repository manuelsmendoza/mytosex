# Description
`MyToSex` is  a novel method for *in silico* sex determination based on the mitochondrial genomes content of bivalves 
that have mitochondrial double uniparental inheritance. Some marine mussels and clams and freshwater mussels have an 
unusual system of mitochondrial inheritance termed double uniparental inheritance (DUI), which involves the 
transmission of two different sex-associated mitogenomes haplotypes to the offspring.  Females contain only F-type 
mitogenomes (mtF) whereas males carry both haplotypes mtF, and also M-type (mtM).  

# Installation
`MyToSex` is an open-source tools written in Python3 that requires the following modules: ... Furthermore, it also calls
third-party software.
